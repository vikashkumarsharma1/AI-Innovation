#Multi-Class Skin Cancer Classification Using Deep  Convolutional Neural Network
Conducted a project on multiclass skin cancer detection utilizing deep convolutional networks.
• Trained various machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests, on a dataset of over 20,000 skin lesion images.
• Fine-tuned and trained deep convolutional networks, including VGG16 and ResNet50, for multiclass classification of skin lesions.
• Employed transfer learning techniques, using pre-trained models and training on larger datasets, to improve classification accuracy.
